Chapter 13: The Handsome One

The magically intensified wind blew against the Hogwarts castle grounds while the black sky rained bloodMeanwhile, in Hagrid's hut, all that was audible was his furniture
Harry Potter thought magic was 'very good'
Rain fell like 'leathery sheets' on top of Harry's ghost as he walked the grounds
Harry came across Ron doing a frenzied tap dance, but once he saw Harry, he started eating Hermione's family
Ron's shirt of himself was just as bad as he was and he looked like a 'loud, slow, and soft bird' to Harry
He did not like to think about birds
Ron spotted Death Eaters on the castle roof and was going to be 'spiders', but he was not proud of it, knowing that he'll be covered in them anyway.

Hermoine suggested that they listen to the Death Eaters' meetings, so the trio made their way to the castle roof door's landing
They almost ran in, but 'witches are not climbing'
Ron then looked at the doorknob, then painfully at Hermoine, saying that the door was closed
Mr Staircase, a resident ghost, elaborated that it was locked
They screamed at the door and asked it to be replaced with an orb
Then, Hermoine cried out the password: 'beef women'.

The trio then stood behind a Death Eater circle, whose members looked 'bad'
One Death Eater confidently kisses another Death Eater on the cheek, and the others clapped for them.

The Death Eaters went over their plan to strip Harry of his magic, and Harry could tell that the Dark Lord was standing behind him
Overreacting, Harry ripped his eyes out of his head (much to Voldemort's confusion), threw them into the Forbidden Forest, and told Voldemort off
Meanwhile, Hermoine dipped the face a tall Death Eater, who was wearing a shirt that said 'Hermione Has Forgotten How to Dance'
Ron threw a wand at the Dark Lord while everyone applauded, then slowly reached for his own while Harry, as he muttered 'Ron's the handsome one', reluctantly did the same
They cast a spell or two while green light shot out of the heads of the Death Eaters, causing Ron to afterwards
Harry thought 'Not so handsome now' as he dipped Hermoine in hot sauce.

The Death Eaters were dead and Harry was hungrier than he'd ever been
Meanwhile, moaning chandeliers filled the Great Hall and a large librarian used masonry books to decorate the sinks
Mountains of mice exploded, long pumpkins fell off McGonagall, Dumbledore's hair then went next to Hermoine as he arrived at the school
The Hufflepuff pig pulsed like a bullfrog, and Dumbledore, smiling at it, placed his hand on its head and told it that it is Hagrid now.

The trio said together that '[They're] the only people who matter
He's never going to get rid of [them]'
The castle floor seemed to be a big magic pile, and the Dursleys weren't ever going to be there
Harry then looked around and fell down the staircase for the whole summer, afterwards exclaiming 'I'm Harry Potter
The dark arts better be worried, oh boy!"
